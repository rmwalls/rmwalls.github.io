So far the Portfolio page is a compilation of most of our homework assignments and group projects in Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. 

<ul>
<li> The Hippo Page - We were tasked with making an HTML page using CSS to showcase our favorite animal.
<li> Silly "Psychic" Game - This early assignment was to create an app to run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 
<li> Bitcoin Collector - The purpose of this game was to learn to dynamically update HTML pages using jQuery. This game also depends on randomly generated numbers. This time the user has to figure out the random value of 4 "bitcoins" and click on them in such a way that they add up to the random number "to match". 
<li> WevDev TriviaPalooza - In this assignment, we were to create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. We also utilized timers. Each question is to be answered in a limited amount of time. 
<li> Using the Giphy API - This was our introduction to using API calls to request data from a third party and then do something with it. In this case, we displayed images and clicked on them to animate and de-animate them.
<li> Magic 8-Ball - This was not a homework assignment, but an extra activity to better understand CSS and positioning.
<li> Tattoo4U - Our first group project! My group's goals were to simplify the search, by first time and infrequent tattoo customers for reputable artists and/or shops. We then wanted to also simplify the results to make it easier to make a choice. We used:
    <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap
        <li> CSS, JS, jQuery
        <li>Yelp API
        <li>MapQuest API
        <li>Firebase
    </ul>
</ul>
